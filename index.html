          <p class="article__text">
            Mieszko I (About this soundPolish (help·info); c. 930 – 25 May 992)[1] was the ruler of Poland[2] from about
            960 until his death in 992 AD. A member of the Piast dynasty, he was a son of Siemomysł, and a grandson of
            Lestek. He was the father of Bolesław I the Brave (the first crowned king of Poland) and of Gunhild of
            Wenden.[3] Most sources make Mieszko I the father of Sigrid the Haughty, a Scandinavian queen, though one
            source identifies her father as Skoglar Toste, and the grandfather of Canute the Great (Gundhild's son), and
            the great-grandfather of Gunhilda of Denmark, Canute the Great's daughter and wife of Henry III, Holy Roman
            Emperor.

            While he was the first Christian ruler of Poland, he continued the policies of both his father and
            grandfather, who initiated the process of creation of the Polish state. Through both alliances and the use
            of military force, Mieszko extended ongoing Polish conquests and early in his reign subjugated Kuyavia and
            probably Gdańsk Pomerania and Masovia. For most of his reign, Mieszko I was involved in warfare for the
            control of Western Pomerania, eventually conquering it up to the vicinity of the lower Oder river. During
            the last years of his life, he fought the Bohemian state, winning Silesia and probably Lesser Poland.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Mieszko I's alliance with the Czech prince, Boleslaus I the Cruel, strengthened by his marriage in 965 to
            the Czech Přemyslid princess Dobrawa, and his baptism in 966 put him and his country in the cultural sphere
            of Western Christianity. Apart from the great conquests accomplished during his reign (which proved to be
            fundamental for the future of Poland) Mieszko I was renowned for his internal reforms, aimed at expanding
            and improving the so-called war monarchy system.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            According to existing sources, Mieszko I was a wise politician, a talented military leader, and a
            charismatic ruler. He successfully used diplomacy, concluding alliances, first with Bohemia, then Sweden,
            and the Holy Roman Empire. In foreign policy, he placed the interests of his country foremost, even entering
            into agreements with his former enemies. On his death, he left to his sons a country with greatly expanded
            territories, and a well-established position in Europe.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Mieszko I also enigmatically appeared as "Dagome" in a papal document dating to about 1085, called Dagome
            iudex, which mentions a gift or dedication of Mieszko's land to the Pope (the act took place almost a
            hundred years earlier).

            It is roughly his borders that Poland was returned to in 1945.

          <p class="article__text">
            Władysław I Łokietek, in English known as the "Elbow-high" or
            Ladislaus the Short (; c. 1260 – 2 March 1333) was the King of
            Poland from 1320 to 1333, and duke of several of the provinces and
            principalities in the preceding years. He was a member of the
            Piast family of rulers, son of Duke Casimir I of Kujawy, and
            great-grandson of King Casimir II the Just.

        <div class="article__invisible">
          <p class="article__text">
            Władysław I inherited a small portion of his father's domain, but
            his dominion grew as some of his brothers died young. He
            unsuccessfully tried to incorporate the Duchy of Krakow (the
            Seniorate Province) in 1289, following the death of his
            half-brother Leszek II the Black and the withdrawal from
            contention of his ally Bolesław II of Masovia. After a period in
            exile during the rule of Wenceslaus II, Władysław regained several
            duchies and then Krakow in 1306 when Wenceslaus III was murdered.
            He temporarily took control of part of Greater Poland after the
            death of his ally Przemysł II, lost it, and then subsequently
            regained it.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Władysław was a skilled military leader, but also an administrator
            - he conquered Gdansk Pomerania, and left it to familial
            governors. For the defense of this territory, he turned to the
            Teutonic Knights, who then demanded an exorbitant sum or the land
            itself as an alternative. This led to an extended battle with the
            Knights, which was not resolved after either a papal trial or
            Władysław's own death. Perhaps his greatest achievement was
            gaining papal permission to be crowned king of Poland in 1320,
            which occurred for the first time at Wawel Cathedral in Krakow.
            Władysław died in 1333 and was succeeded by his son, Casimir III
            the Great.

          <p class="article__text">
            Casimir III the Great (Polish: Kazimierz III Wielki; 30 April 1310
            – 5 November 1370) reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to
            1370. He was the third son of Władysław I the Elbow-high and
            Jadwiga of Kalisz, and the last Polish king from the Piast
            dynasty.

            Casimir inherited a kingdom weakened by war and made it prosperous
            and wealthy. He reformed the Polish army and doubled the size of
            the kingdom. He reformed the judicial system and introduced a
            legal code, gaining the title "the Polish Justinian".Casimir built
            extensively and founded the University of Kraków, the oldest
            Polish university. He also confirmed privileges and protections
            previously granted to Jews and encouraged them to settle in Poland
            in great numbers.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Casimir left no lawful male heir to his throne, producing only
            daughters. When he died in 1370 from an injury received while
            hunting, his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, succeeded him as
            king of Poland in personal union with Hungary.
