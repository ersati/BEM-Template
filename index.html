                <p class="article__text">Władysław I Łokietek, in English known as the "Elbow-high" or Ladislaus the
                    Short (; c. 1260 – 2
                    March 1333) was the King of Poland from 1320 to 1333, and duke of several of the provinces and
                    principalities in the preceding years. He was a member of the Piast family of rulers, son of Duke
                    Casimir I of Kujawy, and great-grandson of King Casimir II the Just.</p>

            <div class="article__invisible">

                <p class="article__text">Władysław I inherited a small portion of his father's domain, but his dominion
                    grew as some of his
                    brothers died young. He unsuccessfully tried to incorporate the Duchy of Krakow (the Seniorate
                    Province) in 1289, following the death of his half-brother Leszek II the Black and the withdrawal
                    from contention of his ally Bolesław II of Masovia. After a period in exile during the rule of
                    Wenceslaus II, Władysław regained several duchies and then Krakow in 1306 when Wenceslaus III was
                    murdered. He temporarily took control of part of Greater Poland after the death of his ally Przemysł
                    II, lost it, and then subsequently regained it.</p>
                <p class="article__text">Władysław was a skilled military leader, but also an administrator - he
                    conquered Gdansk Pomerania,
                    and left it to familial governors. For the defense of this territory, he turned to the Teutonic
                    Knights, who then demanded an exorbitant sum or the land itself as an alternative. This led to an
                    extended battle with the Knights, which was not resolved after either a papal trial or Władysław's
                    own death. Perhaps his greatest achievement was gaining papal permission to be crowned king of
                    Poland in 1320, which occurred for the first time at Wawel Cathedral in Krakow. Władysław died in
                    1333 and was succeeded by his son, Casimir III the Great.</p>
