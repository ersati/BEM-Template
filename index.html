              Władysław I Łokietek, in English known as the "Elbow-high" or
              Ladislaus the Short (; c. 1260 – 2 March 1333) was the King of
              Poland from 1320 to 1333, and duke of several of the provinces and
              principalities in the preceding years. He was a member of the
              Piast family of rulers, son of Duke Casimir I of Kujawy, and
              great-grandson of King Casimir II the Just.

              Władysław I inherited a small portion of his father's domain, but
              his dominion grew as some of his brothers died young. He
              unsuccessfully tried to incorporate the Duchy of Krakow (the
              Seniorate Province) in 1289, following the death of his
              half-brother Leszek II the Black and the withdrawal from
              contention of his ally Bolesław II of Masovia. After a period in
              exile during the rule of Wenceslaus II, Władysław regained several
              duchies and then Krakow in 1306 when Wenceslaus III was murdered.
              He temporarily took control of part of Greater Poland after the
              death of his ally Przemysł II, lost it, and then subsequently
              regained it.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">
              Władysław was a skilled military leader, but also an administrator
              - he conquered Gdansk Pomerania, and left it to familial
              governors. For the defense of this territory, he turned to the
              Teutonic Knights, who then demanded an exorbitant sum or the land
              itself as an alternative. This led to an extended battle with the
              Knights, which was not resolved after either a papal trial or
              Władysław's own death. Perhaps his greatest achievement was
              gaining papal permission to be crowned king of Poland in 1320,
              which occurred for the first time at Wawel Cathedral in Krakow.
              Władysław died in 1333 and was succeeded by his son, Casimir III
              the Great.

              Casimir III the Great (Polish: Kazimierz III Wielki; 30 April 1310
              – 5 November 1370) reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to
              1370. He was the third son of Władysław I the Elbow-high and
              Jadwiga of Kalisz, and the last Polish king from the Piast
              dynasty.

              Casimir inherited a kingdom weakened by war and made it prosperous
              and wealthy. He reformed the Polish army and doubled the size of
              the kingdom. He reformed the judicial system and introduced a
              legal code, gaining the title "the Polish Justinian".Casimir built
              extensively and founded the University of Kraków, the oldest
              Polish university. He also confirmed privileges and protections
              previously granted to Jews and encouraged them to settle in Poland
              in great numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">
              Casimir left no lawful male heir to his throne, producing only
              daughters. When he died in 1370 from an injury received while
              hunting, his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, succeeded him as
              king of Poland in personal union with Hungary.
